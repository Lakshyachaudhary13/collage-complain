College Complaint Management System - Live Project 🚀

I am excited to share a web-based College Complaint Management System I developed! This project allows students to easily submit complaints, suggestions, and feedback through a user-friendly portal, while the admin portal provides comprehensive management features such as tracking complaint status, updating progress, and sending email notifications to keep students informed.

Key Features:
- Student registration with unique Student ID and email integration.
- Complaint submission and status updates with email notifications.
- Admin controls to view, update, and delete complaints.
- Responsive design with an intuitive user interface.
- Built with Node.js, Express, and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend.
- Uses Nodemailer for email functionality.

Try the live project locally:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the 'complaint-management-system' directory.
3. Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
4. Start the server with 'npm start' or 'npm run dev'.
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the system.

I’m open to feedback, contributions, and opportunities to enhance this project further. Feel free to reach out or check my GitHub for the source code!
